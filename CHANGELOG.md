# perevir changelog

Perevir is versioned using [Semantic Versioning][].

[Semantic Versioning]: https://semver.org/

## v0.2.0

Released 2024-07-22.

- Fixed handling of directories: passing a directory to `perevir`
  will run perevirky tests in that directory.

- Add support for "command" tests: these tests allow to specify a
  specific pandoc command in a code block with ID `command`. The
  output is then generated by piping the input through that
  pandoc command.

- Linebreaks in perevirky are preserved when using `-a`.

- Use CommonMark-friendly syntax for code blocks. The new syntax
  ensures that syntax highlighting works even when additional
  attributes are given, too.

- Make`-a` work with perevirky that use divs to mark the expected
  output.

- Various internal refactorings and minor fixes.

## v0.1.0

Released 2024-07-21.

- First release of the library. Нехай буде корисно!
